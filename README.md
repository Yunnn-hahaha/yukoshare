# Yuko Share - Contact Page

This repository contains the source code for the **Contact Us** page of the [Yuko Share](https://yukoshare.com/contact-us/) website. This is a simple one-page website that displays contact information, built using HTML/CSS and hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Purpose

The original Yuko Share website hosted on WordPress has been streamlined to focus solely on the **Contact Us** page. This one-pager will serve as a primary way for users to get in touch.
